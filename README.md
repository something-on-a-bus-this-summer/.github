**Meeting fellow makers is incredible feeling.**

If you're in a city like San Francisco or New York, that's easy, but the hacker spirit is everywhere.

This summer, we're hitting the the road. In our DIY converted minibus, we'll visit 50 cities in approximately 90 days.

At each city we'll run a pop-up hackathon, unconference, or demo session. We'll get together in a park or a similar public space. There'll be free food, good vibes, and awesome people.

For now, we're working things out so expect more details. If you'd be interested in helping out, drop us an email at ~[inbox@summer24.xyz](mailto:inbox@summer24.xyz)~. And, if you've got the ability to support financially, we're raising money at ~[hcb.hackclub.com/summer24](https://hcb.hackclub.com/summer24)~ (our financials are also open-source!).

See you on the road,
